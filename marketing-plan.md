# SimpleInvoice — Marketing Plan

## Positioning
**"The fastest way to invoice your clients."**

SimpleInvoice is for freelancers who hate invoicing software. No bloated dashboards, no 50-field forms, no mandatory signups. Create a professional invoice in under 60 seconds, share a link, get paid.

## Target Personas

### 1. The Solo Freelancer
- Web developers, designers, writers, consultants
- Sends 2-10 invoices/month
- Currently uses Google Docs templates or nothing
- Pain: "I just need to send an invoice, not learn accounting software"

### 2. The Side Hustler
- Has a day job, does freelance on the side
- Sends 1-3 invoices/month
- Wants something free and instant
- Pain: "I'm not paying $20/mo for invoicing software for 2 clients"

### 3. The Small Agency
- 2-5 person team
- Sends 5-20 invoices/month
- Needs basic tracking but not enterprise tools
- Pain: "FreshBooks is too expensive, spreadsheets are too manual"
